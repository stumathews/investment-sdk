# IO.Swagger - the C# library for the Core Investment Tracker API

Investment tracker is a platform that allows you to track aspects that affect your investments

This C# SDK is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: v1
- SDK version: 1.0.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.CSharpClientCodegen

<a name="frameworks-supported"></a>
## Frameworks supported
- .NET 4.0 or later
- Windows Phone 7.1 (Mango)

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies
- [RestSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp) - 105.1.0 or later
- [Json.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) - 7.0.0 or later
- [JsonSubTypes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JsonSubTypes/) - 1.2.0 or later

The DLLs included in the package may not be the latest version. We recommend using [NuGet](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/installing-nuget) to obtain the latest version of the packages:
```
Install-Package RestSharp
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package JsonSubTypes
```

NOTE: RestSharp versions greater than 105.1.0 have a bug which causes file uploads to fail. See [RestSharp#742](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/742)

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation
Run the following command to generate the DLL
- [Mac/Linux] `/bin/sh build.sh`
- [Windows] `build.bat`

Then include the DLL (under the `bin` folder) in the C# project, and use the namespaces:
```csharp
using IO.Swagger.Api;
using IO.Swagger.Client;
using IO.Swagger.Model;
```
<a name="packaging"></a>
## Packaging

A `.nuspec` is included with the project. You can follow the Nuget quickstart to [create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package#create-the-package) and [publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package#publish-the-package) packages.

This `.nuspec` uses placeholders from the `.csproj`, so build the `.csproj` directly:

```
nuget pack -Build -OutputDirectory out IO.Swagger.csproj
```

Then, publish to a [local feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds) or [other host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/overview) and consume the new package via Nuget as usual.

## Getting Started

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using IO.Swagger.Api;
using IO.Swagger.Client;
using IO.Swagger.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class Example
    {
        public void main()
        {

            // Configure API key authorization: Bearer
            Configuration.Default.ApiKey.Add("Authorization", "YOUR_API_KEY");
            // Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
            // Configuration.Default.ApiKeyPrefix.Add("Authorization", "Bearer");

            var apiInstance = new ActivityApi();
            var entity = new RecordedActivity(); // RecordedActivity | the entity to create (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Create a entity
                apiInstance.Create(entity);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling ActivityApi.Create: " + e.Message );
            }

        }

*TransactionApi* | [**Import**](docs/TransactionApi.md#import) | **POST** /api/Transaction/import | 
*TransactionApi* | [**Patch**](docs/TransactionApi.md#patch) | **PATCH** /api/Transaction/{id} | Updates an entity partially
*TransactionApi* | [**Replace**](docs/TransactionApi.md#replace) | **PUT** /api/Transaction/{id} | Replaces and existing Entity.  Note this is not for partial updates, for that use PATCH. This is used for replacing the entire entity.  At the moment it is not possible to replace everything on the existing generic entity with that on the new one and  sometimes we dont want to: we dont want to replace the ID property for example, but we might want to replace  collections in the orignal item with the new collections in the new item, but this is currently not possible in the  implemantation. It just replaces simple members.  ** So if you want to do it propery, override this method in the controller for the type you want to implementa replacement  routine for.
